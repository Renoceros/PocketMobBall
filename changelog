No implementation of throw physics
No texture
Item is recognized in game

Now added textures and pomoball.json
Switched PomoballItem logic to extend from SnowBall Entity
basically copying over SnowBall's data/behavior when you throw the pomoball
👇
Nevermind it still crashes the game AND still has no texture...
More tutorials I guess

Looking at the crash report, it says no client renderer
Ahhhh...
...
No Idea what it means


ALRIGHT damn
fixed client,entity,entitIES,and pomoball.java
so they work ToGeThEr not independently

Now trying to fix the texture issue...
Alright I give up here today idk why they keep vaseline-ing my beautiful 16x16 image, atp using opencv to draw pixel by pixel and write the png would be easier....
